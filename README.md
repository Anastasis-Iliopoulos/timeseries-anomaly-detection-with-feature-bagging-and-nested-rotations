timeseries-anomaly-detection-with-feature-bagging-and-nested-rotations

Anomaly detection on timeseries using two techniques:

- Feature Bagging
- Nested Rotations

## Feature Bagging

Get a random subset of a set of features

## Nested Rotations

Partition a set of features. Apply PCA on each partition. Apply Rotations to each partition.
